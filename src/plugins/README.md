CinsImp Plug-ins
================

CinsImp plug-ins allow you to extend CinsImp to enable it to do things it doesn’t do ‘out-of-the-box’.  Plug-ins can provide all kinds of additional functionality, including:

* Extra icons
* Language extensions; additional commands and functions
* Palette windows
* Extra fonts
* Translators; enabling export of your stacks to a different format
* Importers; for example, the HyperCard import plug-in (in development)
* Database interfaces
* Web interfaces, eg. XML RPC
* Interfaces to third-party applications


Installation
------------

To install a plug-in, simply upload the plug-in folder to the appropriate subdirectory within the plugins directory on your webserver/CinsImp installation.
